# Story: Implement Fork Repository Selection Feature

## Status: In Progress

## Description

As a user, I want to be able to select which fork repository to clone from when using the CLI tool, so that I can choose the most appropriate source for my needs. The selection should support searching and filtering to handle large numbers of forks efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. CLI should provide an interactive selection of fork repositories
2. Fork repositories should be fetched from GitHub API
3. Selection interface should support search/filter functionality
4. Selected repository should be used by DegitManager for cloning
5. Appropriate error handling and user feedback should be implemented
6. Performance should be optimized for large numbers of forks

## Technical Notes

- Created GitHubService for API interactions
- Enhanced DegitManager to support custom repository selection
- Using inquirer.js with autocomplete for interactive CLI
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states
