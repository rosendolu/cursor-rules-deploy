# NPM Package Publishing Guidelines

## Critical Rules

- 🧪 Always run tests before publishing
  - All tests must pass successfully
  - Fail the publishing process if any test fails
  
- 🏗️ Build process must be completed
  - Run the build command specified in package.json
  - Verify build artifacts are generated correctly
  - Fail if build process encounters errors
  
- 📦 Version management
  - Version must be updated using npm version command
  - Only accept valid semver increments: major, minor, or patch
  - Version bump must be committed to git
  
- 🚀 Publishing process
  - Verify user is logged in to npm
  - Ensure package.json is properly configured
  - Run npm publish only after all previous steps succeed
  - Verify successful publication via npm view

## Examples

<example>
  # ✅ Valid Publishing Workflow
  
  # 1. Run tests
  npm test  # All tests pass
  
  # 2. Build package
  npm run build  # Build succeeds
  
  # 3. Update version (interactive)
  npm version patch  # Version updated to 1.0.1
  
  # 4. Publish package
  npm publish  # Package published successfully
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  # ❌ Invalid Publishing Workflow
  
  # Skipping tests and directly publishing
  npm publish
  
  # Publishing without version update
  npm run build
  npm publish
  
  # Publishing with failed tests
  npm test  # Tests failed
  npm version minor
  npm publish
  
  # Wrong version update format
  npm version 1.0.1  # Direct version number instead of semver keyword
  npm publish
