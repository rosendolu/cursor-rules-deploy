# Consolidated Package Publishing Workflow Summary

## Changes Made

We've consolidated the previously separate npm and GitHub Packages publishing workflows into a single unified workflow that:

1. Supports publishing to both npm registry and GitHub Packages
2. Allows selection of target registry at runtime
3. Maintains all existing functionality while reducing duplication

## Key Benefits

### 1. Simplified Workflow Management

- **Single Workflow File**: Maintain just one `.github/workflows/package-publish.yml` file
- **Conditional Logic**: Properly differentiated steps based on selected registry
- **Unified Trigger Points**: Both tag-based and manual workflow triggers in one place

### 2. Enhanced Flexibility

- **Runtime Registry Selection**: Choose target registry when manually triggering the workflow
- **Default Behavior**: Tag-triggered releases default to npm registry
- **Configurable Options**: Specify both version increment type and registry target

### 3. Improved Maintainability

- **Reduced Duplication**: Common steps shared between publishing targets
- **Central Configuration**: Changes to the workflow process only need to be made once
- **Consistent Process**: The same steps and checks are applied regardless of target

## How to Use

### Publishing to npm Registry

**Option 1: Tag-Based**

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**Option 2: Manual Trigger**

1. Navigate to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Publish Package" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select:
    - Release type: patch/minor/major
    - Target registry: npm
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Publishing to GitHub Packages

**Manual Trigger Only**

1. Navigate to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Publish Package" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select:
    - Release type: patch/minor/major
    - Target registry: github
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Technical Implementation

The workflow dynamically configures the environment and publishing process based on the selected registry:

1. **Node.js Setup**:

    - Sets appropriate registry URL based on target
    - Uses the same Node.js version for both targets

2. **Package Configuration**:

    - For GitHub Packages: Automatically updates package.json with correct scope and registry
    - For npm: Uses package.json as-is

3. **Authentication**:

    - For GitHub Packages: Uses built-in GITHUB_TOKEN
    - For npm: Uses NPM_TOKEN from GitHub Secrets

4. **Commit Handling**:
    - Includes package.json in commits only when publishing to GitHub Packages
    - For both: Updates and commits CHANGELOG.md

## Next Steps

1. **Add the workflow to other repositories** that need package publishing
2. **Consider extending** to support other registries if needed
3. **Automate testing coverage requirements** before publishing
