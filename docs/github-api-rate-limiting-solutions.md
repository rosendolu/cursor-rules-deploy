# GitHub API Rate Limiting Solutions Research

## Overview

This document investigates two potential solutions for handling GitHub API rate limits in our application. The research aims to provide a comprehensive comparison and implementation guidance for each approach.

## Current Situation

Currently, our application uses unauthenticated GitHub API requests, which are limited to:

- 60 requests per hour per IP address
- Rate limit information available in response headers
- Current implementation includes basic rate limit detection

## Solution 1: Personal Access Token (PAT) Authentication

### Description

Using GitHub Personal Access Tokens to authenticate API requests.

### Benefits

- Increased rate limits (5,000 requests per hour)
- Access to private repositories (if needed)
- Better request quota management

### Implementation Steps

1. Token Generation and Storage

    - Generate PAT in GitHub settings
    - Store token securely (environment variables)
    - Update Octokit initialization

2. Code Changes Required

```typescript
private constructor() {
    const token = process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN;
    this.octokit = new Octokit({
        auth: token
    });
    this.cache = new Map();
}
```

3. Environment Setup

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
```

### Security Considerations

- Token must be kept secure
- Token rotation strategy needed
- Access scope limitations

## Solution 2: Conditional Rate Limiting with Enhanced Caching

### Description

Implementing a more sophisticated caching and rate limiting strategy.

### Benefits

- Works without authentication
- Reduced API calls
- More resilient to rate limits

### Implementation Steps

1. Enhanced Cache Implementation

    - Increase cache duration
    - Add cache compression
    - Implement cache persistence

2. Smart Rate Limiting

    - Track remaining API calls
    - Implement exponential backoff
    - Add request prioritization

3. Code Changes Required

```typescript
interface EnhancedCacheItem extends CacheItem {
    remainingCalls: number;
    resetTime: number;
}

private async handleRateLimit(response: any): Promise<void> {
    const remaining = parseInt(response.headers['x-ratelimit-remaining']);
    const resetTime = parseInt(response.headers['x-ratelimit-reset']);

    if (remaining < 10) {
        const waitTime = (resetTime * 1000) - Date.now();
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, waitTime));
    }
}
```

## Comparison Matrix

| Feature                   | Solution 1 (PAT) | Solution 2 (Enhanced Cache) |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Implementation Complexity | Medium           | High                        |
| Rate Limit                | 5,000/hour       | 60/hour                     |
| Security Risk             | Medium           | Low                         |
| Maintenance Overhead      | Medium           | High                        |
| Offline Capability        | No               | Yes (with persistence)      |

## Next Steps and Recommendations

### Decision Points

1. Authentication requirements
2. Expected request volume
3. Private repository access needs
4. Infrastructure considerations

### Implementation Phases

1. Phase 1: Initial Setup

    - Choose solution based on requirements
    - Create implementation plan
    - Set up monitoring

2. Phase 2: Development

    - Implement chosen solution
    - Add error handling
    - Create tests

3. Phase 3: Deployment
    - Update documentation
    - Monitor performance
    - Gather metrics

## Questions for Stakeholders

1. What is the expected API request volume?
2. Is private repository access required?
3. Are there any security constraints for token usage?
4. What is the acceptable downtime during rate limit hits?
