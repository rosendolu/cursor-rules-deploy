# Package Publishing Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

1. **Research Documentation**:

    - Comprehensive research on GitHub Actions for package publishing
    - Comparison of npm registry vs GitHub Packages
    - Workflow options and best practices

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:

    - `.github/workflows/package-publish.yml` - a consolidated workflow supporting:
        - Publishing to npm registry
        - Publishing to GitHub Packages
        - Tag-based triggers
        - Manual workflow triggers with registry selection

3. **Guidelines and Documentation**:

    - Detailed publishing guide with step-by-step instructions
    - Troubleshooting information
    - Cursor rule for standardizing the publishing process

4. **Initial Setup**:
    - CHANGELOG.md initialized
    - Workflow structure prepared

## Execution Plan

### Step 1: Complete Project Setup

1. Ensure package.json is properly configured with:

    - Correct name, version, description
    - Build and test scripts
    - Repository information
    - Files to be included in the package

2. Install necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev conventional-changelog-cli
    ```

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Repository

1. Push the current code to GitHub repository
2. Create an npm token if publishing to npm
3. Add the npm token as a GitHub Secret named `NPM_TOKEN`
4. Ensure GitHub Actions are enabled for the repository

### Step 3: Perform the First Release

**Option 1: Tag-Based Release (npm)**

1. Create and push a tag:
    ```bash
    git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial Release"
    git push origin v1.0.0
    ```

**Option 2: Manual Workflow Trigger**

1. Go to GitHub Actions in the repository
2. Select the "Publish Package" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select:
    - Release type: "patch" for the first release
    - Target registry: "npm" or "github"
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Step 4: Verify the Release

1. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow execution
2. Check for successful publishing:
    - For npm: `npm view cursor-rules-deploy`
    - For GitHub Packages: Check the Packages section in GitHub

## Advantages of Consolidated Workflow

1. **Simplicity**:

    - Single workflow file to maintain
    - Consistent process regardless of target registry

2. **Flexibility**:

    - Choice of target registry at runtime
    - Support for both automatic (tag-based) and manual publishing

3. **Efficiency**:
    - Shared steps between publishing targets
    - Reduced duplication in workflow definition

## Next Steps and Maintenance

1. **Future Releases**:

    - Follow conventional commits pattern for automated versioning
    - Use the same workflow process for subsequent releases

2. **Security**:

    - Rotate npm tokens periodically
    - Review GitHub Actions permissions regularly

3. **Improvements**:
    - Consider setting up semantic-release for fully automated releases
    - Add testing coverage requirements before publishing
    - Implement pre-release channels (alpha, beta) if needed
